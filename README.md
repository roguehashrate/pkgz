## Installation

### Option 1: Use the Precompiled Binary

Download the `pkgz` binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/yourusername/pkgz/releases) section.

Move it to a directory in your PATH (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`):

```bash
sudo mv pkgz /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pkgz
```

### Option 2: Build from Source

Clone this repository or download the `pkgz.cr` file.

Compile the program:

```bash
crystal build src/pkgz.cr --release -o pkgz
```

(Optional) Move the compiled binary to your PATH:

```bash
sudo mv pkgz /usr/local/bin/
```

---

## Usage

```bash
pkgz <command> [app-name]
```

You can run commands like:

- `install <app-name>` ‚Äî install an app  
- `remove <app-name>` ‚Äî remove an app from all sources  
- `update` ‚Äî update all package sources  

If multiple sources provide the app, you‚Äôll be prompted to choose.
